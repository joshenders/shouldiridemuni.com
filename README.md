## About

I built this site to make better split-second transit decisions during baseball
season in San Francisco's SoMa neighborhood. After work, you're often faced with
the question: "Should I take the bus home or should I take the Muni train home?".

I can't overstate how bad the consequences are if you make the wrong choice...

In general, out-of-towners (Giants fans) don't really understand the Muni bus
system and use it far less than the Muni train. The bus system is typically the
slower option but on game days, it's A LOT faster and has seating room.

## Performance

The page is optimized for extremely low cellular bandwidth. The whole page
fits in a very conservative TCP MSS of 1380 bytes and is extremly cacheable.
Sadly, I can't count on 0-RTT TLS, so no https (sorry).

## Improvements

It's currently written in Bash and runs as a plain old CGI script. It should
probably be rewritten on Cloudflare's Workers platform.
